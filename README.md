# Network Applications Coursework

This repository contains coursework for **LZSCC.231: Computer Networks and Systems** at Lancaster University. It includes the implementation of a **Multithreaded Traceroute** and a **Web Proxy** based on skeleton code provided during the course.

## Overview
This project demonstrates concepts in computer networking through two main applications:
1. **Multithreaded Traceroute**: A program that maps the route packets take to reach a destination.
2. **Web Proxy**: A proxy server that intermediates requests between clients and the internet.

The implementations are written in **Python**, with minimal use of **HTML** for any auxiliary features.

## Features
- Asynchronous and multithreaded design for enhanced performance.
- Detailed logging of network requests and responses.
- Flexible configurations for both traceroute and proxy services.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eavarady/network-applications-LU.git
   cd network-applications-LU
